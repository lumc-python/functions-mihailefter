# Exercise 4. k-mer counting
#
# Remember Exercise 3 (Analyse a repeat structure) from yesterday's assignment?
#
#     We are going to make a repeating DNA sequence and extract some
#     subsequences from it.
#     - Make a short tandem repeat that consists of three "ACGT" units and five
#       "TTATT" units.
#     - Print all suffixes of the repeat structure.
#       - **Note**: A suffix is an ending. For example, the word "spam" has five
#       suffixes: "spam", "pam", "am", "m" and "".
#     - Print all substrings of length 3.
#     - Print all unique substrings of length 3.
#
#     **Hint**: All elements in a set are unique.
#
# ## (1/2)
#
# Perform the following:
# - Make a function from your implementation.
# - Have `k` as an argument to the function.
# - Test the function on several input strings.
#
# ## (2/2)
#
# Modify your function to use a dictionary with substring counts.
# - Use the substrings as dictionary keys.
# - Use the counts as dictionary values.
# - Have the function return the dictionary.
# - Add a docstring to the function.
# - Use the function to print k-mer counts for some strings.
