# Exercise 5. GC calculator
#
# Write a function that returns the total percentage of `G` and `C` from a DNA
# string (which presumably contains only `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`). For example,
# if the string is `CCGT` the function should return `75.0`.
# - Try running the function with `ACTG123` as argument. What happens? Is this
#   acceptable behavior? Raise a `ValueError` whenever an unsupported character
#   is encountered in the input string.
# - Try running the function with the empty string as argument. What happens? Is
#   this acceptable behavior? Write code to cope with this situation, i.e.,
#   return `0.0`.
# - Add a docstring to the function.
