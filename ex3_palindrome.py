# Exercise 3. Palindrome
#
# Write a function that returns `True` if its argument is a palindrome and
# `False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence
# of characters which reads the same way backward as forward (e.g., `madam`,
# `Able was I ere I saw Elba`, `10101`, `90.09`).
